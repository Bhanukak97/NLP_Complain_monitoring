Inspection Services,The noise level every morning at 7 am is way above the allowed decibel level. beginning at 7 am they are what sounds like taking a circular saw to metal. every single morning for months now i am startled awake from this high pitched noise. the noise is so loud i have resorted to sleeping with earplugs in and even then i am startled/ woken up from the noise. multiple neighbors have complained about the noise. there are newborn babies on this block who are constantly being woken up.

Inspection Services,"I am a disabled tenant, requires wheelchair for mobility.  i was able to walk when i moved into the unit, but now require a wheelchair.  i cannot easily get into the unit because there are 4 steps leading into the unit,  the only way i have been able to leave is by crawling on the floor to my mobility chair in the garage. 
there is a very high grade slope of the floor in the hallway which makes it a very big struggle for me to get my wheelchair to and from my bedroom. the floor in the livingroom is also unlevel so when i transfer from the chair to the couch, my wheelchair will often roll across the livingroom away from me because of the uneven floors. 
lastly, there is a 4ft+ concrete retaining wall facing my bedroom window.  this retaining wall would have to be climbed to escape in case of fire or emergency. so far, the property owner has refused requests to build a small staircase i could at least try to climb in case of fire and emergency. 
request: not necessary to respond in 72hr."
